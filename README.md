## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Custom font
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Notes

The only challenge encountered was that the keyboard disappeared and I was not able to get it back. Received the following error "2016-05-12 11:17:38.554 tipcalc[23815:1355520] Can't find keyplane that supports type 8 for keyboard iPhone-Portrait-DecimalPad; using 4131139949_Portrait_iPhone-Simple-Pad_Default"
